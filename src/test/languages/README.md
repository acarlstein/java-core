# LanguageTest

## Exercise

### L.1
In the files message_en_US.properties and messages_SP.properties, I created the message responseFromWorld.
Use that to write a unit test that implements ResourceBundle or any other alternative.
Try to be original and see if you can come up with something else. 

Just to be clear, this is an exercise of creativity. 
Come up with something interesing (if you can) and share it with the rest.
