# String Manipulation

We have two great tools at our disposition: StringBuffer and StringJoiner.

Since we are going over the Java Core, we make emphasis of the use of StringJoiner
; however, as you will see, we can combine them to obtain great results for our benefit.

# UsingStringJoiner

These unit tests will show you the different ways we can use the StringJoiner.
Also, we exposed you to the StringBuffer so you can see how they can be utilized

# OverSimplifiedJSONUtilityTest

*Note*: We are not going to go over the create of JSON on this course.

This unit test shows you how we can build a JSON using the over simplified JSON utility provided.

Of course, if you wish to work with JSON there are Java libraries/packages available.
I would recommend to use those instead of trying to build your own, 
unless you are willing to spend the time to maintain it.

Some libraries are:

* Java JSON: https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/json/package-summary.html
* Jackson Project: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson
* Google Gson: https://github.com/google/gson
