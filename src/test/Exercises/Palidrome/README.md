# Palidrome

Code in PalidromeTest.class

## Valid Palidrome

Determine if a string is a valid palidrome while considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
FYI, an empty string is considered a valid palidrome.

i.e: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palidrome while "race a car" isn't.

This algorithm has time complexity O(n), since it goes over every character, and has space complexity of O(1)
