# Arrays

## Find intersection Between Arrays

The idea is simple, we are provided with some arrays.
We need to find values that appear in all of these arrays.

So, if we are giving these three arrays:
```
Array1 = {3, 7, 10, 12, 14, 18}
Array2 = {4, 7, 8, 11, 14, 19}
Array3 = {5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14}
```

We can see that the value `7` and `14` appear in all the arrays; 
therefore, we should return an array that contains `{7, 14}`.
