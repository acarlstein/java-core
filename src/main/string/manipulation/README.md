# String Manipuliation using StringJoiner

The StringJoiner is a great alternative for StringBuffer 
since it provides us with extra features that we can use in our advantage.

## OverSimplifiedJSONUtility

The purpose of this class is to give an example on how can we use the StringJoiner.

In this case, I build three simple methods, that combined, could allow us to create simple JSON strings.

The implementation of this class and methods is shown in the unit test created for it.

*Note:* There are way better libraries available to build JSON strings. 

*Idea:* You can use StringJoiner to create your own saving files.
